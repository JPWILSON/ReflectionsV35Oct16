When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you:
	- When you work directly off of GitHub (not often)...
	- Work from more than one work station
	- When you collaborate (so there is more than one person making changes to the repo)
		The 2 points above are both actually collaboration, one is collaborating with yourself

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To do this automatically, GitHub will have to do this with all contributors and workstations from where you may do work....
	Git has no way to know when is the right time to keep items up to date. 

Describe the difference between clones, forks and branches? When would you use one instead of the other? 
 - Forks are for making a clone of another persons repo on GitHub without modifying their repo.
   Forks can only be made on GitHub, not in your local repo.
 - Cloning is when you copy a repo either from internet, GitHub (yours or someone else's account)
   or from your own computer.
   Cloning can occur in either your local repo or on another repo
 - Branches only occur within a single repo, and are different versions of a project, or part of it. A clone or fork of a repo can have many branches in it.  	

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This allows you to fetch the changes from your remote and then go through the changes offline (comparing how it looked since last push/ pull (since thats what the origin/master is))
	and determining if you actually want to merge them into your branch or not.
