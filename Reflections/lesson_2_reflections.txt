What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A hidden git file is created and all changes will now have the 
	opportunity to be tracked. One cannot commit changes if the repository
	has no been initialized - so this step is essential. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temprary storing point, allowing you to pic which files are going to be 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	The staging area allows one to add only the files where the logical changes were done are added. 
	It also allows for review before commiting by comparing with both the working directory
	(git diff [no args]) and with the most recent commit (git diff --staged). The files in the 
	staging area can be moved (only if you are certain that you want to discard the changes)
	by entering git reset --hard.
